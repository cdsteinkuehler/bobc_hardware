Schematic Updates:
<<<<<<< HEAD

  Fix component attributes so all parts have manufacturer part numbers
  Fix component attributes so VALUE field does not separate parts of the same type
    Using the Value field to name connectors makes working with the BOM *PAINFUL*
  Re-annotate to get sane reference designators
x Add fuses and part numbers to the BOM, not just the fuse sockets
x Add shorting jumpers to BOM? (used for setting microsteps, bypassing estop, etc)
x   TE 382811-8
  General cleanup & review all text and notes
  Generate schematic for CRAMP3 (3-channel add-on board)

PCB Updates:
x Label headers
x   P301 ATX power-on
x   JP301 Address/Write-protect
x Move serial header to proper location
  Cleanup board after re-running through auto-router
x Use 1.02 mm drill for Pololu Sockets (65 mil pad / 40 mil drill)
x Merge 1.00 and 1.02 mm drills into same size
x Make all pin-header footprints consistent:
x   1.651 mm pad with 1.016mm hole (.065" x .040")
x Add P8/P9 labels to top of PCB

x = done
- = don't implement
+ = selected choice
  = ToDo
