Schematic Updates:
<<<<<<< HEAD
  Fix component attributes so all parts have manufacturer part numbers
  Fix component attributes so VALUE field does not separate parts of the same type
    Using the Value field to name connectors makes working with the BOM *PAINFUL*
  Re-annotate to get sane reference designators
x Add fuses and part numbers to the BOM, not just the fuse sockets
x Add shorting jumpers to BOM? (used for setting microsteps, bypassing estop, etc)
x   TE 382811-8
  General cleanup & review all text and notes
  Generate schematic for CRAMP3 (3-channel add-on board)

  Review choice of FETs and clamping diodes?

PCB Updates:
  Place compnents
x Preliminary placement of CRAMP3 add-on board to verify connector and mounting hole locations
  Route board
    Manual pre-route as needed
    Auto-route remainder of board
x Update LED footprints to 1608/0603 package
x Locate or create screw terminal parts for 5.0mm and 3.5mm
x ATX power-on connector should be KK series latching connector (like ESTOP)
x Use screw terminal for 5V/12V power connector
x Switch to 0603 discrete components instead of 0805
x Proper mounting hole clearance for #4 hardware (6mm)
x Fix P8/P9 footprint & mounting holes
x Join adjacent screw terminals (P101/P107, P403/P405/P218/P219) on natural pitch (5.0mm or 3.5mm)
- Increase screw terminal pin clearance around BBB P1 (5V DC Power Jack)
-   Not needed, use 1/2 inch spacers between BBB and CRAMPS
x Switch fuse holders to Keystone
x IPC nominal footprints and silk-screen for SMT components:
x   http://landpatterns.ipc.org/default.asp
x   ...too bad KiCAD has no assembly or courtyard layers :(
x Make sure parts that should be on the back of the board are actually *PLACED* on the back of the board
x   BeagleBone P8
x   BeagleBone P9
x   BeagleBone Serial Console
x Shrink board to smaller than 100mm x 100mm
+ Move ATX power-on connector near 5V screw terminal?
+   Added to same connector as 5V and 12V power
+   Split back out into separate 0.1" header to save peripherial I/O space

x = done
- = don't implement
+ = selected choice
  = ToDo
